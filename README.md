# Social Media Chat Analyzer

This project is a social media chat analyzer built with Python and Streamlit. The application provides various analyses on a chat log, including top statistics, activity timelines, activity maps, word cloud, most common words, emoji analysis, and sentiment analysis. The analysis can be done for a specific user or for the overall chat.
